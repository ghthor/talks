## [active] [4] High Level game engine design
Ray expressed interest in this idea.
It wasn't even on my mind that I knew enough about this to talk about it, haaha.
He raised the idea after I mentioned working on my engine.
I don't know if I really know enough to bring this into fruition.

Like, lets see, what type of things could I talk about?

- When to choose a contained client vs client-server architecture
    - Benefits of each design
- Do you have to run a "real-time" world simulation?
    - The differences between say the requirements for a platformer vs a point and click adventure
- Differences in graphical output requirements between 2d & 3d
- Games loops
- Handling user input
- TODO
