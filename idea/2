## [active] [2] Functional programming design using Go
How you can apply FP designs using imperative languages.
How these design look in execution.
How beautiful I think they are.

How much easier these designs are to be read and understood by someone with no FP knowledge.
This is what haskell is doing
It just hides some of the most important knowledge under syntactic suger.
