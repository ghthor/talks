# Have a few ideas for talks I can build out/try
So this morning during checkin Ray expressed interest in a high level discussion about game engine design.

Some ideas have had early this week when it's 2am and I'm trying to sleep but my mind won't shut up.

Yay. This is neat.
Lots of ideas, now just need to build some confidence to stand up and speak my mind.
Haha.
Good fucking luck with that....
